      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        For our final project, we've proposed that we would build an agentic
        Google Chrome extension application. This application's anticipated use
        case was to be able to open the side-panel on a website where the user
        would like a shortened summary of the text provided, and you would be
        given a condensed list of important peices of info relavent to the
        current context. Additionally, users could ask follow-up questions to
        get further information or ask for clarification. The main goal was to
        build an application that acheives the tasks above while also learning
        something new in the process.

              My programming experience going into this project was limited to
              C++ basics and data structures/algorithms that we have been
              learning in class, plus the ability to translate most of the same
              ideas into Java. After hearing my partner's proposal for the
              assignment, I knew I would have a lot on my plate, but I also knew
              that my investment into this project would widen my future
              prospects as a software engineer by exposing me to the core
              fundamentals of web development. I began by putting together a
              roadmap that would help facilitate my studying and still allow us
              to create a working product within the allotted time.
              <br />

              It was important for me to focus on understanding the basic
              building blocks for HTML and CSS, as JavaScript and TypeScript are
              just the languages that allow us to add functionality to the
              elements provided by HTML (buttons, forms, etc). When it came time
              to introduce React to the pallete, I learned about how it can be
              easier to abstract your application's individual components while
              thinking about how and where their functionality can be reused.
              This reusability mindset helps with code readability while also
              making it easier for CSS styling and adding custom visual
              components. As a well-rounded project to practice all of these
              ideas up until this point, I built my own portfolio website in
              which I intend to host this project as well as others in the
              future on.

              For our AI-powered Chrome extension, I needed to bridge the gap
              between website and Chrome extension, and doing this was as simple
              as providing my React project with a manifest.json (MV3). This
              file is used to tell your application how and where to execute
              within Chrome's embedded environment.
