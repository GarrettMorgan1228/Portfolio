      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        For our final project, we've proposed that we would build an agentic
        Google Chrome extension application. This application's anticipated use
        case was to be able to open the side-panel on a website where the user
        would like a shortened summary of the text provided, and you would be
        given a condensed list of important peices of info relavent to the
        current context. Additionally, users could ask follow-up questions to
        get further information or ask for clarification. The main goal was to
        build an application that acheives the tasks above while also learning
        something new in the process.

            <small>
              My programming experience going into this project was limited to
              C++ basics and data structures/algorithms that we have been
              learning in class, plus the ability to translate most of the same
              ideas into Java. After hearing my partner's proposal for the
              assignment, I knew I would have a lot on my plate, but I also knew
              that my investment into this project would widen my future
              prospects as a software engineer by exposing me to the core
              fundamentals of web development. I began by putting together a
              roadmap that would help facilitate my studying and still allow us
              to create a working product within the allotted time.
              <br />
              <br />
              It was important for me to focus on understanding the basic
              building blocks for HTML and CSS, as JavaScript and TypeScript are
              just the languages that allow us to add functionality to the
              elements provided by HTML (buttons, forms, etc). When it came time
              to introduce React to the pallete, I learned about how it can be
              easier to abstract your application's individual components while
              thinking about how and where their functionality can be reused.
              This reusability mindset helps with code readability while also
              making it easier for CSS styling and adding custom visual
              components. As a well-rounded project to practice all of these
              ideas up until this point, I built my own portfolio website in
              which I intend to host this project as well as others in the
              future on.

              For our AI-powered Chrome extension, I needed to bridge the gap
              between website and Chrome extension, and doing this was as simple
              as providing my React project with a manifest.json (MV3). This
              file is used to tell your application how and where to execute
              within Chrome's embedded environment.

              Going into this project, my experience was mainly in Python, C++, and the
              data-structures and algorithmic thinking from class. I had never worked with
              web technologies or built anything for a browser, so I knew I would be
              learning everything from scratch. I created a simple learning roadmap to
              understand the tools we needed and to make sure I could contribute
              effectively throughout the project.
              <br />
              <br />
              I started by learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS to understand how
              pages are structured and styled. After that, I moved into JavaScript and
              TypeScript, focusing on how functionality is added to UI elements and how
              data flows through an application. Introducing React pushed me to think in
              terms of components—how to break features into smaller parts, reuse logic,
              and keep the project organized.
              <br /><br />
              When it came time to turn our React project into an actual Chrome
              extension, I learned how extensions work under Chrome’s environment. I set
              up and configured the manifest.json (MV3), which defines how the extension
              loads, what scripts run where, and what permissions the extension needs.
              Understanding this was key to bridging the gap between a normal web app and
              a working extension.
              <br />
              <br />
              Overall, this project forced me to learn an entirely new tech stack—from
              basic web development, to React, to the specifics of Chrome’s extension API.
              It expanded my skillset beyond class assignments and gave me hands-on
              experience building something functional from the ground up.
